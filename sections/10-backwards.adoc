== Backwards compatibility

Any clients following the approach specified in <<RFC5545>> are
expected to ignore any properties or parameters they don't recognize.

For such clients the series appears to be an unconnected set of
components.  They all have their own unique UIDS.  If the client
updates an instance this should be identical in effect to an update
carried out by a client aware of the new properties.

Updates MUST preserve the SERIES-ID, LAST-SERIES-ID, SRULE, SDATE and
SXDATE properties.  A client which does not do so is in violation of
<<RFC5545>>.
