== Introduction

Since iCalendar was first defined there has been only one way to
express a repeating set of events - the recurrence.  This defined a
master event, a set of rules for computing the instances and a way of
overriding certain instances.

This approach works well enough in certain situations but has many
problems which need to be addressed.

This specification introduces a new approach to repeating patterns of
entities which avoids some of the problems.
