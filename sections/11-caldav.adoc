== CalDAV extensions

This specification may extend Caldav by adding reports to return all
members of a series given the series master UID.  This could be
handled by the current query mechanism but it is likely to be
sufficiently frequently used that a special query is appropriate.

It is also likely we will want a CalDAV operation to split a series
and generate the additional members of the series as a single atomic
operation.
