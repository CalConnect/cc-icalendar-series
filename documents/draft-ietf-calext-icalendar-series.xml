<clause id="introduction" inline-header="false" obligation="normative"><title>Introduction</title><p id="_e9739703-6963-4f7b-8a8f-a35ff1696739">Since iCalendar was first defined there has been only one way to
express a repeating set of events - the recurrence.  This defined a
master event, a set of rules for computing the instances and a way of
overriding certain instances.</p>
<p id="_19b275b7-0bb1-4bda-abb6-50d2192dd088">This approach works well enough in certain situations but has many
problems which need to be addressed.</p>
<p id="_a3aec021-13c7-4c3c-ad58-d3abb3577b55">This specification introduces a new approach to repeating patterns of
entities which avoids some of the problems.</p></clause>

<clause id="_overrides_and_icalendar_recurrences" inline-header="false" obligation="normative"><title>Overrides and iCalendar recurrences</title><p id="_7fe47de6-c9d0-44ce-9fee-f9b5617aa055">The recurrence rules specify how instances are to be computed.  These
rules provide a set of keys - the RECURRENCE-ID - and an instance can
be created with the calculated start date/time and a copy of the
duration (or calculated end date/time).</p>
<p id="_8caa551e-515f-4f45-a4d9-99e897794372">The specification allows for overrides.  These are handled by
supplying a complete replacement for the instance with a RECURRENCE-
ID property matching that of the instance being overridden.  This may
change any of the properties (except the UID) - including start, end
or duration.</p>
<p id="_29b63084-94d9-4451-8a36-3150944e24aa">If a long lived recurrence is heavily overridden it becomes very
cumbersome.  The master plus overrides is considered a single
resource in most circumstances (iTip allows the delivery of a single
instance in certain situations).</p>
<p id="_9a865450-7341-4275-967d-808b2bad595f">Simple meetings can become heavily modified recurrences through adding
the weeks agenda to the description, changing of attendees etc.</p>
<p id="_e7242a50-1ca7-43d1-94c2-8aac7020e62b">There are approaches being considered to mitigate some of these
issues which mostly involve only storing changes but recurrences are
still awkward to deal with.</p>
<clause id="_changing_the_master_start_or_the_recurrence_rules" inline-header="false" obligation="normative"><title>Changing the master start or the recurrence rules</title><p id="_d7ba083c-6817-493a-8b13-eebe0e4d1f69">This can lead to some very difficult problems to resolve.  In the
case of a heavily modified meeting it may be difficult to impossible
to determine which override applies to the newly modified event.</p>
<p id="_4b53b90e-7105-4992-bcbe-b39c24f4dcc5">For example, a weekly book-reading is moved from Monday to Friday.
There are weeks of scheduled events in the future.  Do we move them
all forward to the next instance or skip one and move them back?  If
it becomes bi-weekly rather than weekly do we drop every other or
just space them out more?</p>
<p id="_a3449f02-30f2-412a-b4ea-4b1a0a2baedc">To be sure - some of these problems are not totally resolved by a
series approach but they become more tractable.</p></clause>
<clause id="_splitting_recurrences" inline-header="false" obligation="normative"><title>Splitting recurrences</title><p id="_86ec9d49-fa24-495c-9a16-700305325d70">The <eref type="inline" bibitemid="RFC5545" citeas="RFC 5545"/> THISANDFUTURE range is poorly supported.  Splitting is
what a number of implementations use to avoid changing overrides in
the past.</p>
<p id="_f0a573ee-e31c-436c-9645-49024549e58f">The recurring event is split into 2, one being the truncated original
the other being a new recurring event starting at the time of the
THISANDFUTURE override.</p>
<p id="_b0e96719-3b62-45ac-bf71-d71aa683f74c">There is left the problem of relating the two, this can be
accomplished by use of the RELATED-TO property but that is not
standardized.</p></clause></clause>
<clause id="series" inline-header="false" obligation="normative"><title>Series</title><p id="_f8424f1e-debc-4816-bce3-818ff5e18b19">A series is a, generally regularly, repeating sets of events or tasks
each instance of which is usually, but not always, different in some
respect.  Examples may be a library running an after-school reading
program which usually, takes place at the same time each week but
always differs in the book or author being studied.</p>
<p id="_b68f6dae-f280-4c6f-9d75-f6747cbaafa7">In recurrences an instances is a calculated 'virtual' object, unless
overridden.  It has the same UID as the master and a RECURRENCE-ID
which is always one of the calculated set.</p>
<p id="_ebcd983b-5fc8-4b88-8326-efceaa09c61d">In a series, a specified number of instances are created ahead of
time each with their own unique UID.  They are all related to the
master using a SERIES-MASTER relation type defined in this
specification.  Each instance acts as an individual component as far
as retrieval and searching is concerned.</p>
<p id="_148b6bc6-c4df-4559-8585-5798b2baa218">Each instance and master is identified as a member of the full series
by the SERIES-UID property.  The value of this property is the same
in all members of the series even when splits have occurred.</p>
<p id="_3c8975d9-eb7e-40f8-b05e-f3685cdede40">As instances are created a LAST-SERIES-ID property is added or
updated in the master to indicate which instance was last created.
When there are SXDATE properties this property value may represent an
instance which cannot be created.  It merely represents the latest
calculated date.</p>
<p id="_2ceb866e-6523-42ac-9969-794c2db227fb">This property allows generated instances to be deleted without the
addition of SXDATE properties to the master.  The SXDATE only
indicates future instances which MUST NOT be created.</p>
<p id="_af3b7a2b-c7a3-41a3-85a8-257c71bf8243">As time goes on more instances are created either by the server or by
a client when it inspects the current state of the series.  The
number of instances may be based on time or a count.</p>
<p id="_dd4ee314-f406-46af-8961-1467df32be53">For example, an organization may allow rooms to be booked only 4
weeks ahead.  Thus a series may be set up which has that 4 week set
of events in the future.  Each will have the room as an attendee
ensuring that at least the room is booked at the regular time.</p>
<clause id="_modifying_series_patterns_and_splitting" inline-header="false" obligation="normative"><title>Modifying series patterns and splitting</title><p id="_8d800696-8599-4aeb-8f25-5e33e312210f">If it becomes necessary to modify the series rules or the master
start then the series is always split at the point of the
modification.</p>
<p id="_689627b5-701c-45ab-a68e-d6f3c672e818">When a series is split the previous master is modifed to truncate the
current series at the last generated instance and a parameter
SPLIT=YES is added to the series rule to indicate that this master is
now split.</p>
<p id="_386fa724-52d1-4887-b158-7e969d49a5f6">The split may result in a number of instances related to the old
series but overlapping the new.  It is up to the implementation to
decide what should be done with these but this usually requires a
degree of interaction with a human (or very intelligent robot).  The
application may offer to copy them into the corresponding new
instances - if these can be easily determined, offer to delete all of
them or let the user manually copy information and delete.</p>
<p id="_ec5090e7-8379-4c1d-9c7f-ade82523e882">The new series master is related to the old master by the new series
master having a RELATED-TO property with RELTYPE=SERIES-MASTER
pointing at the previous master.  In that way a backwards chain of
series masters may be created</p></clause>
<clause id="_the_series_master" inline-header="false" obligation="normative"><title>The series master</title><p id="_1f3af80c-7e68-4739-8e8a-e60a71b80b94">A series master is identified in much the same way as a recurrence
master.  It will contain an SRULE and 0 or more SDATE properties or 1
or more SDATE properties.  Additionally it may contain 0 or more
SXDATE properties to exclude instances.</p>
<p id="_4cb1e0c8-d6b7-4190-bff8-b477539d14cf">As noted above, if the series was split it may contain a RELATED-TO
property with RELTYPE=SERIES-MASTER and a value of the previous
series master.</p>
<p id="_690d2a7a-6d1a-47a7-9e7f-d829cab8531a">The master will also contain a LAST-SERIES-ID if any instances have
been calculated and perhaps generated.</p>
<p id="_14bf0e10-e07e-4af4-9528-9bd299e99da3">It is important to note that the series master is the first member of
the series.  Thus the first instance always occurs AFTER the series
master.</p></clause>

is calculated in the same manner as a RECURRENCE-ID.  It MUST also

<p id="_14951c77-df25-4bc4-8238-f756e68fcd71">As noted above, if the series was split it may contain a RELATED-TO

<p id="_bcbb1150-9c38-4156-af2b-937a84e9c4df">The series rule, if specified, is used in computing the
instances to be generated for the series.  These are generated by
considering the master "DTSTART" property along with the "SRULE",
"SDATE", and "SXDATE" properties contained within the series
master.  The "DTSTART" property defines the first instance in the
recurrence set which is represented by that master event.</p>
<p id="_63c33204-cbfd-4a2a-8b94-88205b879e86">Unlike the RRULE the "DTSTART" property MUST be synchronized with
the series rule, if specified.  For example, if the DTSTARTS
species a date on Wednesday but the SRULE specifies every Tuesday
then a server or client MUSt reject the component.</p>
<p id="_ff55702f-33ce-4705-9579-2e5d21133a4d">The final series is represented by gathering all of the start
DATE-TIME values generated by any of the specified "SRULE" and
"SDATE" properties, and then excluding any start DATE-TIME values
specified by "SXDATE" properties.  This implies that start DATE-
TIME values specified by "SXDATE" properties take precedence over
those specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "SDATE" and
"SRULE").  Where duplicate instances are generated by the "SRULE"
and "SDATE" properties, only one instance is considered.
Duplicate instances are ignored.</p>
<p id="_23711e9e-ba74-4028-b531-ea63b0e59fbd">The "DTSTART" property specified within the master iCalendar
object defines the first instance of the recurrence.  In most
cases, a "DTSTART" property of DATE-TIME value type used with a
series rule, should be specified as a date with local time and
time zone reference to make sure all the recurrence instances
start at the same local time regardless of time zone changes.</p>
<p id="_f4c49142-e2d9-4d24-b5af-c45965dfa9fa">If the duration of the series component is specified with the
"DTEND" or "DUE" property, then the same exact duration will apply
to all the members of the generated series.  Else, if the duration
of the series master component is specified with the "DURATION"
property, then the same nominal duration will apply to all the
members of the generated series and the exact duration of each
instance will depend on its specific start time.  For example,
series instances of a nominal duration of one day will have an
exact duration of more or less than 24 hours on a day where a time
zone shift occurs.  The duration of a specific instance may be
modified in an exception component or simply by using an "SDATE"
property of PERIOD value type.</p>

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd><p id="_240b1d17-3e53-4b6f-a6bf-8e8e746a39e0">By default or when VALUE=UID is specified, the property
value consists of the persistent, globally unique identifier of
another calendar component.  This value would be represented in a
calendar component by the "UID" property.</p><p id="_bb025148-dbca-4f93-af0a-1e3dc79f91f6">By default, the property value points to another calendar
   component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
   object.  The "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either
   explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
   referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
   relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
   relationship or a temporal relationship.</p>
<p id="_3ae1940b-186a-43f5-babe-b6d11bdff584">The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
   subordinate of the referenced calendar component.  The CHILD
   relationship indicates that the calendar component is a superior
   of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING relationship
   indicates that the calendar component is a peer of the referenced
   calendar component.</p>
<p id="_57bdd867-1f73-444f-b24f-537051a6f939">The FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART
   relationships define temporal relationships as specified in the
   reltype parameter definition.</p>
<p id="_173d27ce-8ea5-46e0-9ac4-18df1ca7f8a4">The SERIES-MASTER relationship when included in a series instance
  refers to the master of that series.  When included in a series
  master it refers to a previous master in a chain of spilt series.</p>
<p id="_0dc63868-8604-4ed0-8e5c-115f0f69ea41">Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
   have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
   example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
   then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
   and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a
   PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is
   an implied impact to the related CHILD calendar components.  This
   property is intended only to provide information on the
   relationship of calendar components.  It is up to the target
   calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
   relationship.</p></dd>

Subsequent documents will define profiles of this protocol that use specific, interoperable methods of communication between systems.The iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) complements the iCalendar object specification by adding semantics for group scheduling methods commonly available in current calendaring systems.  These scheduling methods permit two or more calendaring systems to perform transactions such as publishing, scheduling, rescheduling, responding to scheduling requests, negotiating changes, or canceling.
